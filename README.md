# How To Play
The arrow keys control the character, and holding shift with the arrows keys controls which direction you are facing.
A: delete wire you are holding; S: place a road in front of you; D: place a pole in front of you; F: place a power plant in front of you, SPACEBAR: anchor a wire at a house, pole, or power plant in front of you; R: restart the game

Gray tiles are factories/power plants, brown are roads, and blue dots are utility poles. The green tiles are various towns you must supply power to. A town has power if it has a yellow circle on top. Power is generated from factories, and transferred by wires. Factories can only output one wire of power, but poles may split into as many wires as you want. Each town only needs one wire of power. **Important**: Wires may not cross or touch each other in any way - except at a pole.

When all the towns have been supplied with power, more towns will randomly appear across the map. Additionally, the player will get more factories, poles, and roads to be placed down at any time, as well as extra turns for the next round. Any items placed down can never be removed, and no two items may be placed in the same square.

There is a turn limit in the top-left corner. Each movement and placement takes a turn. However, when the player crosses a road, such movement only takes 1/2 a turn, instead of a full turn.
# Other Mechanics
When a wire is placed down, and it is powered (i.e., it is linked to some factory), if it ever passes through the center of any square, that square is also powered. Therefore, if a pole or house is directly in the path of a wire, then it is also powered.

The random placement of new towns is not entirely random. The later the level, new towns may spawn farther and farther away from the top-left corner.

Connecting wires or rotating does not consume a turn.
